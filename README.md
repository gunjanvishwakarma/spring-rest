# Spring Boot RESTful Web Services Annotations

This README provides an overview of commonly used annotations in Spring Boot for creating RESTful web services. These annotations enable you to build robust and efficient APIs.

## Controller Annotations

- `@RestController`: Marks a class as a RESTful controller that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
- `@Controller`: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.
- `@RequestMapping`: Maps HTTP requests to specific methods in the controller. Can be used at class or method level.
- `@GetMapping`: Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with HTTP GET method.
- `@PostMapping`: Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with HTTP POST method.
- `@PutMapping`: Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with HTTP PUT method.
- `@DeleteMapping`: Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with HTTP DELETE method.
- `@PatchMapping`: Shortcut for `@RequestMapping` with HTTP PATCH method.

## Parameter Annotations

- `@PathVariable`: Binds a method parameter to a path variable in the request URL.
- `@RequestParam`: Binds a method parameter to a query parameter in the request URL.
- `@RequestBody`: Binds the body of the incoming HTTP request to a method parameter.
- `@RequestHeader`: Binds a method parameter to a header value in the request.
- `@CookieValue`: Binds a method parameter to a cookie value in the request.

## Response Annotations

- `@ResponseBody`: Indicates that the return value of a method should be serialized directly into the response body.
- `@ResponseStatus`: Sets the HTTP status code for the response.

## Exception Handling Annotations

- `@ControllerAdvice`: Global exception handling for controllers.
- `@ExceptionHandler`: Handles exceptions at the method level within a controller.
- `@RestControllerAdvice`: Combines `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ResponseBody` for global exception handling in RESTful controllers.

## Validation Annotations

- `@Valid`: Indicates validation constraints to be applied to a method parameter or return value.

## Model and View Annotations

- `@ModelAttribute`: Binds a method parameter to a model attribute, often used in form handling.
- `@SessionAttributes`: Specifies which model attributes should be stored in the session between requests.

## Cross-Origin Annotations

- `@CrossOrigin`: Configures cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for a controller or method.

## Other Annotations

- `@RequestMapping` (with additional attributes): More comprehensive version with additional attributes for fine-tuning request mapping.
- `@RequestBodyAdvice` and `@ResponseBodyAdvice`: Customize request and response body handling globally.
- `@RestControllerAdvice` (with assignableTypes): Limit exception handling to specific controllers.
- `@RestControllerAdvice` (with basePackages and basePackageClasses): Limit exception handling to specific packages or classes.

Feel free to mix and match these annotations according to your specific use case and requirements to create powerful and well-structured RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.
